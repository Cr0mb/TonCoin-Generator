These projects are intended solely for educational purposes to help individuals understand the principles of cryptography and blockchain technology. It is important to recognize that attempting to generate Bitcoin wallets in the hope of randomly finding one with a balance is not a feasible strategy. This same logic applies to any tool that tries to work in any way the same as this.

The number of possible Bitcoin wallet combinations exceeds 76 trillion, making the odds of discovering an active wallet astronomically low. To put it into perspective, you are statistically far more likely to win the lottery every day for the rest of your life than to recover even a single wallet with fundsâ€”even over the course of a decade.

# TonCoin-Generator
This script generates Toncoin wallets and checks their balances using the [TonCenter API](https://toncenter.com/api/v2/getAddressInformation?address={}). If a wallet contains a balance greater than zero, it is saved to a text file. The script uses the tonsdk library to generate wallets and requests to fetch wallet balance data.


## Features
1. Generate Toncoin Wallets: Creates wallets with mnemonics, private keys, and addresses.
2. Balance Checking: Fetches the wallet balance from the TonCenter API.
3. Save Wallets with Positive Balances: If a wallet has a non-zero balance, it is saved to a file.
4. Rate Limit Handling: Implements rate limit handling with automatic retries.

## Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
```
pip install tonsdk requests colorama pyfiglet
```


## How It Works
- Wallet Generation: The script generates a new Toncoin wallet using the tonsdk library, creating a public address, private key, and mnemonic phrase.
- Balance Fetching: The script uses the TonCenter API to fetch the balance of the generated wallet address. If the balance is greater than 0 TON, it saves the wallet data.
- Output: The script outputs the wallet information (address, private key, mnemonic, and balance) in the terminal and saves any wallet with a balance to the wallets_with_balance.txt file.
